# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-and-ML

Project task is segmenting customers with K-Means which is given in the Task 5. Previous sections are included in this file to observe the differences between the performance of machine learning methods and RFM scores in segmentin customers. Project tasks are as follows;

- **1. Analysing and preprocessing dataset**
- **2. Calculation of RFM metrics**
- **3. Calculating RFM scores**
- **4. Modelling with K-Means**
